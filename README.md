> “Animals are such agreeable friends—they ask no questions; they pass no criticisms.” George Eliot  

<br>
This app is intended to bridge a major gap in the pet-owning world, syncing vet records and pet history with their microchip number. With this tool vets and owners can fill in details on each micro-chipped pet, which will then be available for reference at any time. 
<br>
In the case of rescue animals- shelters, and adoptive families and their veterinarians, will no longer need to guess about an animal's past information. 
<br>
<br>
For a few years I ran a pet business, doing pet care involving both pet walks and overnight stays. Many of the animals I cared for were rescues, and the owners had to guess at their pasts. This app would fill in that gap, streamline and simplify pet information and pet care.
